    "Based on the performance of all solvers it's easy to say that random is the worst. On average it attained a score 50000 points below the rest. It's variance is also huge having over 1m difference in some results. Nearest neighbour taken from the end was far better, but still worse than the rest. It's best sollution was over 10000 points worse than the rest. It's better counterpart, nearest neighbour from any point, attained score of 168648.0 on instance A and 141524.0 on instance B. It is worth mentioning that it might not always be strictly better than nearest neighbour, due to greedy nature of both the algorithms. Lastly the greedy cycle performed the best of all 4, but not by much. The lowest of all it's scores was 130700.0 attained on instance B. It is worth mentioning that all algorithms were really fast, as they had only n^2 complexity. Over all looking at the graphs it is easy to see that all the greedy algorithms are far from optimal, and take routes that only seem good at first, not realising the big picture."
