    "\n",
    "Overall local search, when calculating the cost changes of moves, performs quite quickly. The number of iterations it performs depends on how far it is from some local optimum, which depends on the ruggedness of the fitness landscape. So it performs longer when starting from a random solution as opposed to starting from a heuristic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from a random solution the solver is able to improve it quite a bit, however it will often stop at some local optimum far from the optimal solution. Because of that starting from a solution generated by a heuristic is important as, depending of the shape of the landscape, it may reach an unsatisfying local optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting from random solutions, greedy seems to perform better than steepest as it explores more and delays the convergence into a local optimum. However when starting from heuristic solution, steepest is better as it is already close to a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swapping nodes seems to be a better option than swapping edges when starting from a heuristic solution. Presumably because it is generally a smaller and a less disruptive operation, which smoothes the travel across the fitness landscape. Inversely, because edge swaps are bigger than node swaps, they allow more exploration. This allows it to perform better when starting from a random solution than a heuristic one."
